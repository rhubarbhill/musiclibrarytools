But even if I completely tuned out these phenomenal lyrics, I would still adore how much this song perfected the soft rock sound, creating such a dreamy and ethereal atmosphere with nothing but the typical rock band setup. I would still adore how Stevie Nicks sounds like an angel trying her best not to cut a bitch (even without processing the lyrics, you can still sense the tremors). I would still adore how the band members seem similarly at ease while also threatening to burst at any moment. Those cymbal crashes, especially, are like ocean waves crashing on a California beach. / I would still adore how like the oceans (spilled oil and plastic aside), every note, every second of this song just feels so natural. It all just flows together effortlessly like it was always meant to be that way, despite being infamously borne from strife. No other song has the pieces fit quite this flawlessly. No doubt, Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" is my favorite song of all time","""Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions. I keep my visions to myself.

Any time I see this song, I think ""No way this is my #2 favorite song ever, the nostalgia isn't that strong,"" but then I listen to it at any mood, at any time of day, and I'm teleported to a different place entirely. And as someone who's gotten increasingly less nostalgic about the past for a variety of reasons, it's incredible how this has aged so well that for three and a half minutes, I'm reminded of the brighter side of nostalgia and what makes it so valuable in the first place. For some of my favorite songs, I've mentioned how they can sometimes conjure a picture show of memories in my mind. Well, if ""Thinking of a Place"" is for road trip and adventure-related memories and ""Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You"" is for all the beautiful and precious things I've seen (especially in nature), then ""Lights"" is for all the people I cherish the most, all the places I would visit annually for holidays, and all the formative events that occurred there or in auditoriums I would visit for one golden occasion and then never again.

Meanwhile, the rest of the band anchors the dream world to something more tactile with their crisp, hypnotic, well-measured performances; this song courses through two phenomenal guitar solos like they're NOTHING, it's insane.

And yet, in a life where there the waves keep coming, where there is no such thing as a happy or sad ending, just the morning after, it ends up being the most fitting and prescient song I've ever used as a celebration theme.","""And in the mornin', sun hits the water.

The fact that it's by a rich woman actually amplifies the melancholy, as if to say that even someone who has the widest possible range of options for happiness still can't escape the itch of existentialism, wandering, and listlessness. That these lyrics were blessed to be accompanied by one of the most richly produced, softest clouds of sounds possible and a vocalist who sings like an Earthen angel almost feels like proof of some hidden force of divinity.

Calling this a hype anthem almost feels reductive. It's pretty much just a Kanye West anthem and nothing else. The outro, where he contemplates suicide and having the power to ""let power go"" is, if anything, proof of his absolute genius. It's one of his most humble and vulnerable moments cleverly inserted into an otherwise proudly self-aggrandizing song, a little taste of the rock bottom of the obscured ""Never See Me Again"" manifesting in a mainstream crowd-pleasing rap song. It's also an implicit acknowledgment that he fears he is at his peak and he may as well go out while still on top, as if he's scared he might fade away if he stays. Seriously, that entire outro is probably one of the most remarkably chilling and profound moments in Kanye's entire discography","""You got the power to let power go?"" is such a ridiculously phenomenal lyric I can't even begin, really, and the way ""go"" is IMMEDIATELY punctuated with the manic ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" sampling is insanely hype. See ""Comments"" for more + The rest of the suicidal outro + ""I embody every characteristic of the egotistic / He knows he's so fuckin' gifted"" + The ""Fuck SNL"" part which I don't even know the original context of yet it still manages to hit hard somehow + ""At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit""",English,,,,,$-GPM,,12/31/2020,Kanye West - Power,,00693,2020-12-31 00693,,,,#cc0000,#ffd966
